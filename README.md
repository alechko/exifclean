# exifclean

Simple EXIF tags cleanup script for Linux

This is a super simple script to clean some of the Exif data from image using exiftool.
You can get exiftool from here: http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/

#### Usage
  `exifclean [-d|-D] FILENAME1 FILENAME2 ...`

    -d: delete the original copy generated by exiftool with confirmation
    -D: force delete of the original copy generated by exiftool

#### Setup
  * Download the script (I use /home/user/bin) and add execute permissions.
  * Generate excludes file based on image:
    * For quick export of all tags and generate your own exclude file you can use:
      `exiftool -s FILENAME | awk '{ print $1 }' > exifclean_exclude`
    * To see the full list of tags for your image you can use:
      `exiftool -a -g1 FILENAME`
  * Remove tags you want to keep from the generated file and put that file into script folder.
    `mv exifclean_eclude /home/user/bin/exifclean_exclude`

#### TEST
  Copy your original image and run the script on the copy
  `cp FILENAME test.jpg; exifclean test.jpg; exitool test.jpg`

#### Notes
  * I never use this on RAW files, only on the finalized versions exported from my raw editor,
    I suggest you to do the same.
  * exiftool will by default leave a copy of the image with format FILENAME_original,
    if you didn't use the delete [-d|-D] flags, you can revert the changes by:
      `exiftool -restore_original FILENAME`
